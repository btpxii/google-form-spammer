# google-form-spammer
Python code to automate random Google Forms responses


Currently works on forms with short / paragraph answer, multiple choice, checkbox, and dropdown questions. Will not work on forms with multiple pages, required login, or field types that weren't mentioned above.

Created for fun, and not meant to be used in any malicious manner.
